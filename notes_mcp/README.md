# Project Analysis: MCP Notes Server

This project is a practical implementation of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server focused on note management. It demonstrates how to expose custom tools, resources, and prompts to AI agents using the MCP standard.

## Project Structure
- **main.py**: The core implementation file. It sets up an MCP server using FastMCP and defines several tools and resources for note management.
- **notes.txt**: A simple text file used to store notes persistently.
- **README.md**: Documentation and overview of MCP and this project.
- **pyproject.toml**: Project metadata and dependencies.

## Main Features
- **Add Note Tool**: Allows agents to append new notes to the notes.txt file via the `add_note` tool.
- **Read Notes Tool**: Enables agents to read all notes from the file using the `read_notes` tool.
- **Latest Note Resource**: Exposes a resource (`notes://latest`) to retrieve the most recently added note.
- **Note Summary Prompt**: Provides a prompt (`note_summary_prompt`) that generates a summary request for all current notes, demonstrating how prompts can be used in MCP for higher-level AI tasks.

## How It Works
- The server is started by running `main.py`, which registers all tools, resources, and prompts with the MCP protocol.
- Agents (or users) can interact with the server to add, read, or summarize notes, or fetch the latest note, all through standardized MCP calls.

## Example Usage
- Add a note: Use the `add_note` tool with a message string.
- Read all notes: Use the `read_notes` tool.
- Get the latest note: Access the `notes://latest` resource.
- Summarize notes: Use the `note_summary_prompt` prompt to generate a summary of all notes.

This project serves as a template for building more complex MCP servers that expose custom tools and resources to AI agents, making it easy to extend with additional functionality as needed.
